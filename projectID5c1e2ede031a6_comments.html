<HTML><BODY>The very first book I posted to Project Gutenberg some 18 years ago was about a naturalist visiting Borneo and the Philippines (eBook <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2564">2654</a>: <i>Wanderings among South Sea Savages and in Borneo and the Philippines</i> by H. Wilfrid Walker); and this book is a similar travelogue published some 30 years before that one took place--quite a lot had changed!

<p>No particular difficulties expected, so have fun!
